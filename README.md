# fuqua-mqm-2022
Deep learning workshops for the Fuqua Masters of Quantitative Management (MQM) program in spring 2022

+DS Deep Learning Workshops for Fuqua-MQM

In this 3-part series of workshops for the Fuqua Master of Quantitative Management (MQM) program, Duke experts in machine learning will introduce the mathematics and statistics at the foundation of modern machine learning, discuss case studies that provide context for the methods that have formed the foundations of rapid growth in artificial intelligence, and provide hands-on training in the latest machine learning software using the widely used PyTorch framework.

Billy Carson's instructions on how to upload coding session notebooks into Google Colab:

- To use Google Colab, a Google Account is required. If you do not already have one and would like to code along/run the notebooks, you can create a Google Account at https://www.google.com/account/about/. If you have an active Gmail account, then you already have a Google Account.
- Download both Jupyter Notebook files with .ipynb extensions (mqm_intro_pytorch.ipynb and mqm_intro_pytorch_complete.ipynb) to your computer.
- Open a web browser tab and go to Google Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/.
- A window should pop up. Click on the "Upload" tab on the top right corner of the window. Click on "Choose File". Navigate to the folder/directory on your computer where the downloaded Jupyter Notebooks are located, and upload one of the files. Google Colab should automatically open the uploaded Jupyter Notebook.
- To upload the other file, click on "File" in the upper left corner of the page, and click on "Upload Notebook" from the drop-down menu. Google Colab should automatically open the second Jupyter Notebook just uploaded.
- Choose which notebook to open depending on how you want to follow along during the coding session by clicking on "File" in the upper left corner and selecting "Open notebook". The same window that popped up when you first opened Google Colab should appear. Select which notebook you want to follow along with by selecting it from the "Recent" notebooks tab.
